### STORY ###
Once upon a time, an old mother pig had three piglets. Unfortunately, she didn’t have enough food to keep them, so she sent them out to seek their own luck.

When the first pig went out, he met a man with a bundle of straw. The pig said, “Sir, please give me the straw so I can build a house.” The man gave him the straw, and the pig built a house out of straw.

Soon after, a big bad wolf passed by. He knocked on the door and said, “Hey, little pig, let me in.”

The pig replied, “No, no, not by the hair on my chinny chin chin.”

“Then I’ll huff and I’ll puff and I’ll blow your house in,” said the wolf. And so he did. He huffed and he puffed, and he blew the door down. The little pig quickly ran away to his brother.

His brother, the second pig, had met a man with a bundle of sticks. The pig said, “Sir, please give me the sticks so I can build a house.” The man gave him the sticks, and the pig built a house out of sticks.

He was sitting in his house feeling proud when he heard a knock on the door. It was his little brother. “The wolf blew my house down! Please can I stay here?”.

“Of course, my house is made of sticks, it’s safe for sure!” his brother said.

Then the big bad wolf came by the house made of sticks and said, “Hey, little pig, let me in.”

“No, no, not by the hair on my chinny chin chin,” replied the pig.

“Then I’ll huff and I’ll puff and I’ll blow your house in,” said the wolf. And so he did. He huffed and he puffed, and he blew the door down. The two pigs quickly ran away to their other brother.

The third pig had met a man with a load of bricks. The pig said, “Please, sir, give me those bricks so I can build a house.” The man gave him the bricks, and the pig built a house out of bricks.

He was sitting in his house when he heard a knock on the door. It were his brothers! “The wolf has blown our houses down! Please can we stay here?”

“Of course, my house is made of brick, it’s safe for sure!” the brother said. “But the wolf will surely come around here. Let’s make a plan to make sure he never bothers us again.” So the three little pigs came up with a plan. And just like the pig predicted, the wolf came to his house…

The big bad wolf came to the house made of bricks and said, “Hey, little pig, let me in.”

“No, no, not by the hair on my chinny chin chin,” replied the pig.

“Then I’ll huff and I’ll puff and I’ll blow your house in,” said the wolf.

So the wolf huffed and he puffed and he huffed and he puffed and he huffed and he puffed, but he couldn’t blow the door down. He soon realized he couldn’t open the door by huffing and puffing.

Then, of course, the wolf became angry and decided that he would come after the pigs through the chimney.

But the three little pigs knew what he was planning to do and they had hung a water kettle over the fire. And just as the wolf came down the chimney, he took the lid off the kettle. The hot steam reached the big bad wolf and with a big howl the wolf shot up!

“Ouch, ouch, ouch! Oh you pigs! I will get you some day!” and the wolf ran away as fast as he could.

And after that? The big bad wolf never came back again, he was too scared of the three smart little pigs.

And the pigs? They lived happily ever after, together in the house made of bricks.

### First Prompt

System Role Prompt (default):

```text
You are a friendly and informative AI chatbot conversing with a human.
```

User Role Prompt:

```text
Write a Python script to extract all values from the 'First Name' column as a list of strings, sorted in ascending order.
Do not repeat any values. The data is in a file called 'data/customers-100000.csv'. Below is a sample of that CSV file's header row:

Index,Customer Id,First Name,Last Name,Company,City,Country,Phone 1,Phone 2,Email,Subscription Date,Website
```

Sample Python script from inference:

```python
import pandas as pd

def extract_first_names(file_path):
    try:
        # Read the CSV file
        df = pd.read_csv(file_path)

        # Extract unique values from the 'First Name' column
        first_names = df['First Name'].unique()

        # Sort the list in ascending order
        sorted_first_names = sorted(first_names)

        return sorted_first_names

    except FileNotFoundError:
        print("The file does not exist.")
        return None
    except pd.errors.EmptyDataError:
        print("The file is empty.")
        return None
    except pd.errors.ParserError as e:
        print(f"An error occurred while parsing the file: {e}")
        return None

# Usage:
file_path = 'data/customers-100000.csv'
first_names = extract_first_names(file_path)

if first_names is not None:
    print(first_names)
```

## Example 5b: Code Generation using System Prompt

temperature: 0.50

### First Prompt

System Role Prompt:

```text
You are an expert programmer who writes Python 3 code in a Pythonic style. Pythonic refers to an approach to Python programming that embraces the idioms and practices considered natural or idiomatic in the Python programming language. It embodies the philosophy and best practices that lead to clear, concise, and readable code. Pythonic code is also performant, resilient, efficiently catches specific exceptions, and uses the latest Python 3 features.

Important: You should always optimize code for performance over the use of convenience libraries and use Python functions to separate functional concerns, including a main() function.
```

User Role Prompt:

```text
Write a Python 3 script to extract all values from the 'First Name' column of a CSV file as a Python list of dictionary objects containing the values as strings ('names'), sorted in ascending order, along with the count of each unique value ('count'). Do not repeat any values. Require a command-line argument for the 'path' to CSV file. Output the results as Name: {name}, Count: {count}, sorted in descending order by counts and secondarily, in ascending order by name. Explain your decisions. Below is a sample of that CSV file's header row:

Index,Customer Id,First Name,Last Name,Company,City,Country,Phone 1,Phone 2,Email,Subscription Date,Website
```

### Second Prompt

Try running this more than once to see if code incrementally improves.

User Role Prompt:

```text
Refactor the code to adhere to PEP 8 guidelines and optimize it for performance, taking into account any existing constraints or requirements.
```

Sample Python script from inference:

```python
